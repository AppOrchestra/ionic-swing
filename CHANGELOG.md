## [0.0.4](https://github.com/peterpeterparker/ionic-swing/compare/v0.0.3...v0.0.4) (2017-04-26)

### Features

* **lib:** Lodash replaced by underscore.js ([#1]https://github.com/peterpeterparker/ionic-swing/issues/1)
* **lib:** Angular, rxjs and zone updated to reflect Ionic 3.1.0 dependencies ([#3]https://github.com/peterpeterparker/ionic-swing/issues/3)

### Comments

The main reason behind the replacement of lodash by underscore is the size of the library. In an Ionic app the size of the bundle is a major factor regarding the boot time, therefore, smaller the libs are, faster the app boot will be.
